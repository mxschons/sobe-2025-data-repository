Anton,Remove,"Lytton, 2008 – wrong link. And which paper are you thinking about here? Is it this one? That is a review article, and not original research. Does it really have results from a simulation of a piece of human brain that gets such high scores on the various aspects in your table?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anton,Probably Remove,"Kasabov, 2014 – wrong link. Is it this paper? Where does it do a simulation of a piece of human brain?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anton,Auditory still brain?,"Verhulst et al., 2018 – wrong link. Is it this paper? But it seems to be simulating auditory processing outside of the brain proper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anton,Corrected,"Pronold et al, 2024 – if I recall correctly, they simulate 3.5 million neurons, which is 0.004% of neurons in the human brain. That is minuscule compared to what Yamazaki et al. and Lu et al. did (complete or near-complete coverage of all the brain’s neurons), and yet the “Percentage of Neurons” are scored at 2 for all these papers. It certainly should be 1 for Pronold et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anton,,"On a similar note, “Connectivity Accuracy” is scored at 2 for all human papers except the first two. However, the connectivity accuracy of all these studies is, of course, by far less than what we did for the mouse in Billeh et al. (these data are simply not available for human), and yet the score is the same. I would recommend lowering it for all the human papers. And it’s probably best to do the same for Functional Accuracy too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anton,Deep dive,"And at least some of the mouse papers are not simulation papers. I think I left some detailed comments on that previously, maybe in an earlier version of the doc or in the poster? Please try to find them – I remember looking carefully into these papers and finding some issues that needed to be addressed. One example that I do remember is that Rodarie et al. is not a simulation paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
