        "In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), training computation is predominantly measured using floating-point operations or “FLOP”. One FLOP represents a single arithmetic operation involving floating-point numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. To adapt to the vast computational demands of AI systems, the measurement unit of petaFLOP is commonly used. One petaFLOP stands as a staggering one quadrillion FLOPs, underscoring the magnitude of computational operations within AI.",
        "Modern AI systems are rooted in machine learning and deep learning techniques. These methodologies are notorious for their computational intensity, involving complex mathematical processes and algorithms. During the training phase, AI models process large volumes of data, while continuously adapting and refining their parameters to optimize performance, rendering the training process computationally intensive.",
        "Many factors influence the magnitude of training computation within AI systems. Notably, the size of the dataset employed for training significantly impacts the computational load. Larger datasets necessitate more processing power. The complexity of the model's architecture also plays a pivotal role; more intricate models lead to more computations. Parallel processing, involving the simultaneous use of multiple processors, also has a substantial effect. Beyond these factors, specific design choices and other variables further contribute to the complexity and scale of training computation within AI."
